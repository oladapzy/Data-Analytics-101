# Data-Analytics-101
Land inventory in Chicago.
The dataset for this project was pulled from chicago city database, I put the link in the project above.
I was able to download the raw csv file from the dataset, clean it and get the list of lands or property available for sell and sold in chicago, get the community that has the highest and lowest land available for sell, sold and or lease.
Also it appears that the City of chicago has a lot of land available for sell compare to private ownsers.
This is my first data analytics project and I believe there is still room for improvement.
Thanks for stopping by!!!!!
